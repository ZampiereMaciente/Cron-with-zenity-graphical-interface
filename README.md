# Cron with zenity graphical interface

#### A graphical interface for cron, the Linux task scheduler, using Zenity, offers a simple and interactive way to schedule and manage cron tasks without the need to edit configuration files directly in the terminal. Zenity can be used to create graphical dialog boxes such as menus, forms, and text boxes that facilitate user interaction. For example:

* Data entry: The user can provide the task to be scheduled (such as a script command) and the execution interval (minutes, hours, days, etc.) through text boxes or checkboxes.
* Visual confirmation: A dialog box can display the scheduled task for confirmation before it is saved in cron.
* Notifications: Message boxes can be displayed to inform the user of the success or failure of the operation.
